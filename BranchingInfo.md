* Each Group member will select 4 days of puzzles (one person takes 5) and works on completing those puzzles, actively commiting revisions to the puzzle to the designated branch.
    - Somebody will also have to design the CSS styles and make the page layout nicely, this also has its own branch.

* Since we have to submit a single github repo to Mr. Peck, and we need all the puzzles to intergrate onto a single page it makes sence, that way we don't have to make more work for ourselves later by merging everyone's code manually into a new Repo and hoping nothing is inadvertantly overridden.
    - This also shows Mr. Peck that we are utalizing git properly which he has evaluated in his grading for past projects.

* Due to the quantity of puzzles (50 total considering each day has 2) it seems rather nessessary to divide and conqur the puzzles rather than to all work on the same puzzle at the same time.
